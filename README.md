## Temporary note for Thinkful grader
As I included Bootstrap icons for the buttons in my code, I am currently unable to submit through Qualified, as it does not seem to support the Bootstrap icons module. The tests all pass on my local computer (see image below), so hopefully you are able to mark 31.2 complete for me, assuming my code passes!
